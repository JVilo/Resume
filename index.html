  <p>I am hard working and compassioned. I try to find positivity in everything I do. I love helping people, I do it as my job but it follows me everywhere I go.
    I like solving problems and I will persevere to find solutions. I am interested in developing and creating new solutions to existing problems in my field of work. I am starting my journey to be a programmer and am excited to see where it will take me.</p>
